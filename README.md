# Project-01-Refactoring
Our first project as students in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp was a code refactoring exercise that simulated an 'on-the-job' ticket. 

For this assignment we were tasked with taking an existing HTML and CSS codebase and refactoring it to meet accessibility standards as well as making it easier to read for any developer who might work on it in the future.

Changes I made to the codebase included adding appropriate id tags in order to fix links, adding alt attributes to images to improve accessibility, replacing div elements with more semantically appropriate elements, refactoring the CSS page in accordance to changes made to the HTML in order to maintain the site's appearance, consolidiating redundant rules, and leaving comments in the code base for contextual reasons.
